This is a small python csv conversion file from a text to a csv file. The script does split the data into two columns, crop and body. You can split it as you wish. It has some explanations on the right side of the code. The reason is to see how it works, and of course this is the first time I am working with python.

The first line split would be after ('. ') a period and space.

The code works great, I am running it on python 2.7.10.

Make sure your txt files are in the same directory or add a folder to it if that is the case. Make sure to add on the code after "with open('/folder/nameofthefile.txt.'). It's the same way when you create the csv file.
